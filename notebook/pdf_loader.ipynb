The \\ngreatest advances have occurred in the field of games playing. The best computer chess programs are now \\ncapable of beating humans. Today, the hottest area of artificial intelligence is neural networks, which are \\nproving successful in a number of disciplines such as voice recognition and natural-language processing. \\nThere are several programming languages that are known as AI languages because they are used almost \\nexclusively for AI applications. The two most common are LISP and Prolog. Artificial intelligence is working \\na lot in decreasing human effort but with less growth. \\n \\nKeywords: Data mining, Epistemology, Ontology, Heuristics, optimization \\nIntroduction \\nArtificial intelligence is defined as developing \\n \\nWormhole (AKA the Einstein -Rosen Bridge) is a             \\ntheoretical concept and a solution to Einstein’\\nfield equations of general relativity. Simply put, \\nwormholes are tunnels connecting two different \\nregions of space -time (Fig 2) (Darling, n.d.). \\nAlthough scientists are still unaware about the \\nimplications of the infinite curvature of spacetime in \\na black hole, they seem to be able to provide the \\nimmense forces of gravity required to curve space -\\ntime into a tunnel, thereby making wormholes a \\nplausible theory, but not one that is practical. Due to \\nthe infinite force of gravity in a black hole, a \\nwormhole wou ld collapse the moment it forms by \\nsinking into the black hole. Furthermore, to stabilize \\na wormhole, a substance known as “exotic matter” \\ni.e., matter with a negative mass, energy and density, \\nis required. Although this substance exists \\nmathematically, it  hasn’t been detected in the \\nobservable universe (Tillman et al, 2022). However, \\ncounter arguments have come forward in light of \\nnew research suggesting that if there is a quantum \\nconnection (Fig 3) between two black holes, “exotic \\nmatter” may not be required to stabilize the tunnel. If \\nsuch wormholes indeed do exist in black holes, then \\nquantum information entering the black hole will be \\nable to travel through the wormhole into another part \\nof the universe, thereby solving the paradox of loss \\nof informatio n in a black hole (Wolchover, 2017). \\nHowever, as none of this research has empirical \\nevidence, no definitive claims can be made. As the \\nname suggests , white holes are fundamentall \\nopposite to black holes. While it is impossible to \\nescape from a black hole,  it would be impossible to \\nenter a white hole (Xiao, n.d.). Both white holes and \\nblack holes look similar in nature when observed \\nfrom space, however, the brief expulsion of matter is \\nwhat differentiates the two. Viewing a white hole \\nwould almost be like a  “time reversal” of viewing a \\nblack hole (Wood, 2022). However, white holes at \\nbest can be called an impossible possibility, mainly \\nbecause of two reasons. Firstly, for the existence of a \\nwhite hole on the other side of a black hole, a \\nwormhole would be required to exist inside the black \\nhole joining two regions of spacetime (Fig 4). As \\nseen above, it is highly unlikely for such a theory to \\nbe true. Secondly, white holes fail to obey the second \\nlaw of thermodynamics –entropy (a measure of how \\nmany different states particles in a system can be in) \\nin the universe can either remain the same or it can \\nincrease; however.  computer programs to solve \\ncomplex problems by applications of processes that \\nare analogo\\nAccording to the current mining situation and the bottoming scheme, it is preliminarily determined'),\n",

These services are provided \\nwith an intention to reduce maternal morbidity \\nand mortality ( 1, 2). ‘WHO indicates that \\nmaternal health should help the mother to fulfill \\nnatural experience that is emotional to the mother \\nand reduce potential challenges where they suffer \\nhealth-wise and sometimes even death’. Prior to \\nCOVID-19 pandemic, maternal health was \\nalready affected by increased maternal mortality \\nand morbidity attributed to decreased so cial-\\neconomic status, cultural values and geographical \\nremoteness. These factors increase the risk for \\npregnancy-related illnesses, negative \\nconsequences after birth and maternal death more \\nin developing countries than in developed \\ncountries. Recently, the  COVID-19 pandemic is \\nfeared to have negative impact on maternal health \\n(3-5).

It is related to \\nthe similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that \\nare biologically observable. While no consensual definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI) exists, AI is broadly characteriz ed \\nas the study of computa tions that allow for perception, reason and action.  Today, the amount of data that is generated, by \\nboth humans and machines, far outpaces humans’ ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. \\nArtificial intelligence forms th e basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making.  This paper \\nexamines features of artificial Intelligence, introduction, definitions of AI, history, applications, growth and achievements . \\n \\nKEYWORDS- machine learning,deep learning,neural networks,Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Base System         \\n \\n            INTRODUCTION- \\n \\nArtificial Intelligence ( AI ) is the branch of computer science which deals with intelligence of machines where an intelligent agent \\nis a system that takes actions which maximize its chances of success. It is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things \\nthat make people seem intelligent. The central principles of AI include such as reasoning, knowledge, p lanning, learning, \\ncommunication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. It is the science and engineering of making intelli gent \\nmachines, especially intelligent computer programs \\n \\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS: \\nMachine Learning- \\nIt is one of the applications of AI where machines are not explicitly programmed to perform certain tasks; rather, they learn  and \\nimprove from experience automatically. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural netw orks for \\npredictive analysis. There are various machine learning algorithms, such as Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning, and \\nReinforcement Learning. In Unsupervised Learning, the algorithm does not use classified information to act on it without an y \\nguidance. In Supervised Learning, it deduces a function from the training data, which consists of a set of an input object an d the \\ndesired output. Reinforcement learning is used by machines to take suitable actions to increase the reward to find the best possibility \\nwhich should be taken in to account. \\nNatural Language Processing(NLP) \\nIt is the interactions between computers and human language where the computers are programmed to process natural languages. \\nMachine Learning is a reliable technology for Natural Language Processing to obtain meaning from human languages. In NLP, the \\naudio of a human talk is captured by the machine. Then the audio to text conversation occurs, and then the text is processed where \\nthe data is converted into audio. Then the mach ine uses the audio to respond to humans. Applications of  Natural Language \\nProcessing can be found in IVR (Interactive Voice Response) applications used in call centres, language translation applications \\nlike Google Translate and word processors such as Microsoft Word to check the accuracy of grammar in text. However, the natur e \\nof human languages makes the Natural Language Processing difficult becaus e of the rules which are involved in the passing of \\ninformation using natural language, and they are not easy for the computers to understand. So NLP uses algorithms to recogniz e \\nand abstract the rules of the natural languages where the unstructured data f rom the human languages can be converted to a format \\nthat is understood by the computer. \\nAutomation & Robotics- \\nThe purpose of Automation is to get the monotonous and repetitive tasks done by machines which also improve productivity and \\nin receiving cost -effective and more efficient results. Many organizations use machine learning,  neural networks, and graphs in'),\n",

Such automation can prevent fraud issues while financial transactions online by using CAPTCHA technology. Robotic \\nprocess automation is programmed to perform high volume repetitive tasks which can adapt to the change in different circumstances. \\nMachine Vision- \\nMachines can capture visual information and then analyze it. Here cameras are used to capture the visual information, the analogue \\nto digital conversion is used to convert the image to digital data, and digital signal processing is employed to process the data. Then \\nthe resulting data is  fed to a computer. In machine vision, two vital aspects are sensitivity, which is the ability of the machine to \\nperceive impulses that are weak and resolution, the range to which the machine can distinguish the objects. The usage of mach ine \\nvision can be found in signature identification, pattern recognition, and medical image analysis, etc. \\nKnowledge-Based Systems(KBS): \\nA KBS can be defined as a computer system capable of giving advice in a particular domain, utilizing knowledge provided by a \\nhuman expert. A distinguishing feature of KBS lies in the separation behind the knowledge, which can be represented in a numb er \\nof ways such as rules, frames, or case s, and the inference engine or algorithm which uses the knowledge base to arr ive at a \\nconclusion. \\nNeural Networks: \\n \\nNNs are biologically inspired systems consisting of a massively connected network of computational “neurons,” organized in layers. \\nBy adjusting the weights of the network, NNs can be “trained” to approximate virtually any nonlinear function to a required degree \\nof accuracy. NNs typically are provided with a set of input and output exemplars. A learning algorithm (such as back propagat ion) \\nwould then be used to adjust the weights in the network so that the network would give the desired output, in a type of learning \\ncommonly called supervised learning. \\nApplications of AI \\nArtificial Intelligence has various applications in today's society. It is becoming essential for today's time because it can solve \\ncomplex problems with an efficient way in multiple industries, such as Healthcare, entertainment, finance, education, etc. AI  is \\nmaking our daily life more comfortable and fast. \\nFollowing are some sectors which have the application of Artificial Intelligence:\"),\n",

In cybersecurity, machine learning algorithms can automatically \\nfind and evaluate security incidents. Since the late 1980s, researchers have attempted to integrate \\nML in cybersecurity solutions, but progress has been gradual.

Malware Classification \\nMalware, short for malicious software, refers to any software designed to harm or exploit \\ncomputer systems. It can take many forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and \\nmore. Malware is a significant threat to individuals and organizations, as it can cause damage, \\nsteal sensitive information, and disrupt operations. \\nOne potential solution to this threat is the use of AI in malware classification. AI can analyze and \\nclassify malware based on various features, such as code, behavior, and impact. This can help \\ncybersecurity professionals identify and neutralize threats more efficiently and effectively. \\nThere are several approaches to malware classification using AI. One approach is to use machine \\nlearning algorithms to analyze the code of a piece of software and classify it as malware or \\nbenign. This can be done by training the algorithm on a large dataset of both malicious and \\nbenign software, allowing it to learn the characteristics that distinguish one from the other. \\nAnother approach is to use AI to analyze the behavior of a piece of software. This can be done by \\nrunning the software in a virtual environment and observing its actions. AI can then classify the \\nsoftware based on whether its behavior is typical of malware or benign software.\"),\n",

As it is exposed to more data, it can \\nimprove its ability to identify legitimate users and detect and prevent cyber attacks. This can help \\nit stay up-to-date with the latest threats and more effectively protect against them. \\nThere are also some challenges to using AI in cyber security solutions. One challenge is that it \\nrequires a large amount of data to train the algorithms accurately. This can be difficult to obtain, \\nespecially for rare or novel types of cyber attacks. \\nAnother challenge is that AI can sometimes make mistakes, particularly when it is exposed to \\ndata that is significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can lead to false positives \\nor false negatives, which can have serious consequences in the cybersecurity context. \\nDiscussion \\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential of AI for cyber security purposes, there are still \\nareas for improvement. One potential issue is the need for large amounts of data to train machine \\nlearning models, which can be a challenge in the fast-paced and constantly-evolving world of \\ncyber security. \\nAdditionally, there is a need for further research and development in the use of AI for real-time \\nuser behavior analysis and access verification. As cyber threats continue to evolve and become \\nmore sophisticated, the ability to quickly and accurately verify user access is crucial. \\nOverall, the use of AI for user access verification in the context of cyber security holds \\nsignificant potential. Through the development and refinement of machine learning models and \\napproaches, it is possible to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of user behavior analysis \\nand access verification, and improve overall security on a network. However, there is still room \\nfor improvement and continued research and development in this area is necessary to fully realize \\nthe potential of AI in this context. \\nConclusion \\nThis study provided an up-to-date overview of AI applications in cyber security according to \\nprevious research and assesses the potential for improving cyber security capabilities by \\nrecommending that security systems' intelligence be increased more quickly.
